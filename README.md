# SongLibrary-Project
This is a project exercise where we made a Java class to keep track of a song's information and methods to add, remove, sort, update, and print all songs.

Overview of the project:
For this project, we made a Java class that tracks a song's information (in Song.java) and then we made the appropriate methods to add, remove, update information, print and sort the songs using different sorting algorithms.
