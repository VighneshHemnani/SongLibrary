# SongLibrary-Project
This is a project exercise where we made a Java class to keep track of a song's information and functions to add, remove, sort, update, and print all songs.

Overview of the project:
For this project, we made a Java class that tracks a song's information (in Song.java) and then we made the appropriate methods to add, remove, update information, print and sort the songs using different sorting algorithms.

  1. **IO.java and IO.html**:
      - The IO class (IO.java) is a class developed that holds easier functions to read and/or output the appropriate data type. Download and open IO.html in a browser to read more about the IO class and its functions. 
      - The methods are as below:
        - **readInt()**: ask (and force) the user to enter an integer.
        - **readString()**: ask (and force) the user to enter text.
        - **readDouble()**: ask (and force) the user to enter a real number.
        - **readChar()**: ask (and force) the user to enter a single character.
        - **readBoolean()**: ask (and force) the user to enter text that can be interpreted as a boolean (valid responses: "t", "f", "true", "false", "yes", "no", "y", "n").
        - **outputIntAnswer(int i)**: print an integer to the screen and/or send it to the grading script. 
        - **outputStringAnswer(String s)**: print a string to the screen and/or send it to the grading script.
        - **outputDoubleAnswer(double d)**: print a real number to the screen and/or send it to the grading script.
        - **outputCharAnswer(char c)**: print a single character to the screen and/or send it to the grading script.
        - **outputBooleanAnswer(boolean b)**: print a boolean to the screen (e.g. "true" or "false") and/or send it to the grading script.
